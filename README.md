# Obsidian AI Token Counter

AI large language models process text using tokens, which are common sequences of characters found in a set of text. The models learn to understand the statistical relationships between these tokens, and excel at producing the next token in a sequence of tokens.
This plugin shows the total count of tokens in your Obsidian note.
